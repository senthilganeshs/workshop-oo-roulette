# Incremental Design

---

# Software Development Challenges

- Software is developed in increments
- Adding incremental change requires refactoring existing code.
- Refactoring gets harder and risky as the code gets bloated.
- After several iterations, we tend to document the limitations and learn to live with the pain instead of fixing it.

---

# What if we incorporate Refactoring as a design technique?

---

# Incremental Design
- Use tests as feedback mechanism for design
- Refactor the code to address the complexity in consumer logic (Keep the test code simple and no Mockito :) )
- Single Responsibility Principle.
- Good design is as little design as possible.

# American Roulette
- Wheel consist of numbers from 0 to 36.
- Dealer spins a ball on outer rim of the wheel after which it will eventually fall into one of the numbered spaces.
- The objective of the player is to guess what number the ball will land in.
- Before each spin, players can bet on individual numbers or any combination of numbers.
- Once the ball falls into a pocket and rests the dealer will call out winning number.
- Types of bets: straight, split, street, square, basket, double street, Columns, Dozens, Lows/Highs, Evens/Odds, Reds/Blacks, ..
- Payouts 35:1, 17:1, 11:1, 8:1, 6:1, 5:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:1, 1:1 res..,

# Summary
- Complexity of design increases exponentially with upfront design.
- Itâ€™s linear in Incremental design - very few alternatives to consider and design principles help with choosing right from wrong.
- More smaller refactoring in incremental design.
- Tests verify both design and implementation in Incremental design.
